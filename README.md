In the customer review of more then 960,872, I picked the top 20 of the total amount to give a thorough analysis. 
The analysis of the review is an unbiased opinion because of the average rating from customers is higher with 
verified customers. There are higher ratings with less votes, the vines votes are trustworthy.
